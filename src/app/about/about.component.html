<h2>Company Policies</h2>
<p>In any conversation, saying who you are and what you do is basic to good manners. In business, it's also good to establish credibility and respect by explaining your company's origins, how you view your business, and how you relate to the community. The Web is very depersonalized, but from our earliest usability studies, we've seen that users like getting a sense of the company behind the website.
Having a good About Us section facilitates this understanding. Clearly stating what you do helps customers understand your site as a whole. Of course, your overall site is what ultimately represents your organization to users. People look at product pages and read the site's content when they're evaluating an organization as a possible vendor, business partner, employer, investment, or (in the case of charities) donation recipient. Communication isn't restricted to About Us. But dedicating an area to providing users with facts about your organization and its history and values helps pull all of the site's content together.
